# **Flash Card Application**

## About
A 'Flash Card' application developed in Python using the Tkinter package for the user interface and the Pandas package for data handling.

The 'Flash Card' application helps users learn the Spanish language by memorizing the 1000 most frequently used Spanish words. Initially, a Spanish word is displayed, and the user is given 3 seconds to recall the English meaning of the word before the flash card flips to display the English meaning. The user then presses the ✅ or ❌ button based on whether they were able to remember the meaning. If the user presses the ✅ button, the current card will not reappear, and the word is removed from the "words to learn" list. Once the ✅ or ❌ button is pressed, a new Spanish word is displayed. This process continues until the user has learned all 1000 Spanish words or decides to quit. When the application is restarted, the words that have already been learned will not be shown in the flash cards.

The 'Flash Card' application can be modified to learn any other language or terminologies simply by updating the data file and titles used.
